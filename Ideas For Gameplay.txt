Two complementary windows: main game windoe and a toolbox
The toolbox will allow you to select the number you want to begin placing
Once you select a number it will also highlight all those other number labels which have been placed
On each button you hover over the number you have selected will appear
Once a user has clicked on the button (and it's correct), the button will turn to text display the number

Behind the scenes:
Determine the winning grid by placing one number in various places (different on each turn)
Then depending on difficulty, show some numbers as text to begin with

Easy:
0-6 per box - 10-13 per row, 32
